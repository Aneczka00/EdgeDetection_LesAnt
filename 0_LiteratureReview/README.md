  - **Objective**:  
This study aims to develop a new kinematic model for the early opening of the Equatorial Atlantic Ocean, addressing challenges posed by limited magnetic data and complex fracture zones. Its goal is toto re-evaluate tectonic settings, including continental margins and the Cretaceous Jurassic Line (CJL). The research also intends to improve understanding of the triple junction's evolution between the Equatorial Atlantic, Central Atlantic, and proto-Caribbean oceans, and its implications for Lesser Antilles Arc subduction hazards.

  - **Methods**:  
The researchers used GPlates and PyGPlates software to create their kinematic reconstruction. They built upon the Moulin et al. (2010) South Atlantic model, updating timing of rotations based and adjusting continental block boundaries in northern South America. The methods used were as follows:  
  
  a) Gravity and bathymetry data to identify major tectonic features like fracture zones (FZs) and continental margins  

  b) Multi-Channel Seismic (MCS) and structural data to define continental margin types and their boundaries (COBs)  

  c) Gravity-derived Moho depth and global sedimentary thickness maps for inland plate boundaries  
  
  The study used identified FZs, especially the Cretaceous Jurassic Line (CJL), to reconstruct the ocean's opening direction and initial continental fits. Seismic data    helped interpret the CJL's structure and sedimentary infill. The model proposes a two-phase rifting process, with distinct plate movements in each phase, constrained    by known timings and South Atlantic rotations.

  - **Outcomes**:  
The study presents a new kinematic model for the Equatorial Atlantic, identifying two regions divided by the St Paul Fracture Zone. It outlines a two-phase rifting history: the first phase involved strike-slip movement between West Africa and the Guyana block during the Early Cretaceous, while the second phase saw northward movements leading to oblique rifting. The Cretaceous Jurassic Line (CJL) is identified as an Early Cretaceous transform fault that later became a rift zone, with chaotic sediments from this rifting. Additionally, the Amazon basins acted as a boundary for early plate movements. The model suggests significant implications for the Lesser Antilles Arc subduction zone, including revised oceanic boundaries and the subduction of Equatorial Atlantic crust around 3 million years ago, linked to intermediate earthquakes due to dehydration in the lithosphere.  
  
  - **Relation to the Project**:  
This reference is the key part of my internship, as it helps define a new understanding of the North American-South American (NA-SA) plate boundary. The CJL offers a fresh look at how the North American, South American, and African plates separated. My goal during this internship is to support and prove this idea.
